# A Physics Analysis of Large Hadron Collider Data
## (Ph.D. thesis)

I processed three terabytes of proton-proton collision data to test the fundamental theory of particle physics and to search for physics beyond this theory. The topic of my dissertation is "The Measurement of the W$\gamma$ Cross Section at 8 TeV with CMS detector". This is the first measurement of this process at a given energy.

The project included but was not limited to the following steps:
- data cleaning;
- feature engineering;
- exploratory data analysis;
- data visualization;
- maximum likelihood fits;
- Monte Carlo simulations.

I used particle physics data analysis tools developed at CERN (ROOT/RooFit) with C++ in Linux.

The result confirmed the fundamental theory of particle physics, no deviations were found.

# Kaggle Kernels
## (studying machine learning and data science)

While over ten years in particle physics research gave me an extensive hands-on experience in data analysis, data visualization as well as related soft skills, it has one little problem: the tools we are using are not very common outside of our research area.

To learn how to speak the same language with data scientists from a wider range of fields, I study Python and machine learning through online courses and test my knowledge playing with kaggle tasks. To get a better understanding about my proficiency with Python data science tools like Pandas, seaborn etc, you are welcome to take a look at
