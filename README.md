# A Physics Analysis of Large Hadron Collider Data
## (Ph.D. thesis)

I analyzed three terabytes of proton-proton collision data to test the fundamental theory of particle physics and to search for physics beyond this theory. The topic of my dissertation is "The Measurement of the W$\gamma$ Cross Section at 8 TeV with CMS detector". This is the first measurement of this process at a given energy.

To perform this measurement, I implemented and applied various statistical learning techniques, including but not limited to maximum likelihood fits, decision trees, and Monte Carlo simulations. I used special data analysis packaged for particle physics ROOT/RooFit with C++ in Linux.
